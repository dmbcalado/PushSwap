<p><strong>This project has the goal of creating an algorithm that is step-efficcient into sorting a stack of integers (a) by only using  with rescrict </strong></p>
<p><strong>Important: <p>To run the program you first need to install X11, XShm extension and libbsd-dev package, by typing in the terminal:</strong></p>
<p><strong>sudo apt-get install gcc make xorg libxext-dev libbsd-dev</strong></p>
<p><strong>After that, enter the folder mlx_linux and run ./configure</strong></p>
<p>*This program is built to run on Linux and most of the utilities in MacOs will fail since the int sent by each key has a different value.*</p>
<p>In the mandatory part, the task given is to have a program that would be able to:</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Offer the option of the chosing both <strong>Mandelbot</strong> and <strong>Julia sets</strong>.</li>
<li>Offer the option to zoom on mouse wheel.</li>
<li>Be able to exit the program by pressing ESC or by clicking in the cross(x) in the window.</li>
</ul>
<p>So the way i aproached the problem is let the user choose by typing:</p>
<p><strong>1 - $&gt; ./fractol mandelbrot</strong></p>
<p><strong>2 - $&gt; ./fractol julia</strong></p>
<p><strong>3 - $&gt;./fractol julia (<span style="color: #0000ff;">double</span> x) (<span style="color: #0000ff;"><em>double</em></span> y)</strong></p>
<p><strong>4 - $&gt; ./fractol hourglass (a mathematical incorrect yet beautifull fractal I've created.)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Results:</strong></p>

<p>The first image shows the Mandelbrot set with 300 iterations. The second one, The Julia set with c = -0.78i with 300 iterations, and the third image is deep inside one Julia set choosed by the mouse click, once again with 300 iterations. </p>
<p><strong>Some extra features I added:</strong></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: square;">
<li>Ability to <strong>move</strong> the image with <strong>W A S D</strong> or the <strong>arrow keys</strong>. (increases the speed with the zoom).</li>
<li><strong>Increase or decrease</strong> the iterations with the <strong>'+'</strong> and <strong>'-'</strong> keys on the numpad.</li>
<li>For the Mandelbrot set, choose where to zoom by mouse clicking the spot in the image (once). For the Julia set, change the c parameter by mouse clicking the new values. (The new value will be displayed on the terminal).</li>
<li>A <strong>night mode</strong> by <strong>pressing 'N'</strong>.(and rechange to normal mode by re-pressing it).</li>
</ul>
<p>I could go into details what's the mathematics behind each set but nowadays you can find it almost everywhere. If you have literally zero insights, I would however recomend you the numberphile videos (since i really enjoy them and probably you will understand at least the concepts),</p>
<p>There is of course some points in the job that could be better. The first great feature that i can think of is a scalable with zoom axis, to really be able to get a more mathematical aproach on this program.</p>
<p>The second thing that i can think of is to really be able to zoom where the mouse stands, that would have been great however i couldn't understand how to do so on minilibx library.</p>
<p>As my grade i got 125, getting full grade on the mandatory and the bonus part. (Thanks to a strong defense the knohow of my collegues on how hard it is to do some of the steps with just mlx library).</p>
